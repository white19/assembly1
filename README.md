# assembly1
Write an ARM assembly code to implement a prog1
program which can remove the space and numbers (0-9) of the input string. In
addition, it will also convert the capital letters into the small ones. The result
will be printed into the screen. For example, when you execute this program as
follows:
arm-none-eabi-run prog1 “Tom is 8 years old.”
Then the screen should show the following result:
The string output: tomisyearsold.
